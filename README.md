The general process here is to use my own hacked version of the main function from the [`hexSticker`](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/hexSticker) package which produces a vectorized `.pdf` rather than the standard `.png`. This allows me to lift the template into vector editing software (in my case, Affinity Designer) for fine tuning.
